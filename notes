SQL Commands/techniques



Back and REstore

mysqldump --opt -u [uname] -p[pass] [dbname] > [backupfile.sql]

mysqldump --opt -u <> -p <> measurements meterReadings

mysql -u [uname] -p[pass] [db_to_restore] < [backupfile.sql]


Other useful options:

--add-drop-table	will delete a current table before creating a new one
--no-data		will simply copy the table structure
			This is what I want!



New user created:
	pi_manage
	Ass1ngt0n

	Needs permissions: Lock Table

Developing a single shell script to:

	pull_struct	<from_database> <from_table> <name to save to on s3>
	pull_data	<from_database> <from_table> <name to save to on s3>
	push_data	<to_database> <name to pull from on s3>			Table will be named as per the source dB

Prior to use, need to install s3cmd

Use:
	sudo yum install s3cmd (AWS)


Then need to create a key and shared secret to set up s3cmd to your s3 instance

On AWS, in the IAM section, add a new user:
	Name the user after the instance name, i.e. ChapelRoad2017
	Choose the programmatic access
	Add the user to the s3Group already set up
	Copy the Access Key ID and shared secret
	
Use the command: s3cmd --configure to supply these details

Create an encryption pasword and accept remaining defaults

Create user account for pi_manage on your databases
